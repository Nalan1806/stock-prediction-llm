# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with LLMs (Work in Progress)

This project explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can assist in building and evaluating stock price prediction models with minimal coding. Instead of writing code fully from scratch, I interacted with **Google's Gemini in Colab** to generate code, explanations, and strategies.

---

##  Project Overview
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (Apple Inc. â€” AAPL, 2020â€“2023)
- **Goal**: Use LLM-powered workflows to:
  1. Load and analyze historical stock price data
  2. Engineer features (moving averages, volatility, indicators)
  3. Train models (Regression, Random Forest)
  4. Evaluate performance with metrics (RÂ², accuracy, classification report)
  5. Discuss possible trading strategies.

---

##  Key Learnings
- LLMs can generate code for **data loading, feature engineering, and ML models**.
- Managing the **LLMâ€™s context window** is critical when building step-by-step workflows.
- While the predictions showed potential, LLM-generated strategies still require **human critical thinking** before being applied in finance.

##  Status
 **Work in Progress** â€” experimenting with:
- Better feature sets  
- Alternative ML models  
- Potential integration with a web dashboard  

---

##  Future Direction
- Deploy as a **dashboard app** (Next.js + Supabase)  
- Explore integration with real-time financial APIs  
- Compare LLM-assisted workflows with traditional Python-only pipelines
